# PNG to ICO Converter

![PNG to ICO Converter](png-ico.ico)

A simple and user-friendly tool to convert PNG images to ICO format. Perfect for those looking to create an icon from a PNG image file. This utility streamlines the conversion process for a hassle-free experience.

## Why Convert PNG to ICO?

Many software applications and websites require icons in the `.ico` format, especially for favicons in web browsers or application icons in Windows. While PNG is a popular format for images due to its lossless compression, ICO serves a unique role by allowing multiple resolutions to be stored in a single file, which can be particularly useful for responsive design. If you're developing a website, software application, or just want to customize the icons on your desktop, this tool will bridge the gap between the flexibility of PNG and the specificity of ICO.

## Features

- Intuitive GUI for selecting the input PNG file, save location, and ICO file name.
- Auto-validation for input fields.
- Prevents accidental overwrite by checking if the ICO file already exists.
- Optimized for Windows x64.
- In-app update checker.
